    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input image, perform neural style transfer to transform it into a brush stroke painting. The generated image is then analyzed by breaking down its colors to display a visual palette. Finally, a first suggestion for the painting is provided using color segmentation to create a series of images\n",

    "### Style image\n",
    "\n",
    "The style image used for the transformation is the next:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The VGG19 network, which is widely used in style transfer algorithms, is employed as the model in this case. This pre-trained network is utilized to extract the content and style representations from the input images. The extracted features are then employed to generate a new image that merges the content of one image with the style of another image.\"\n",

    "### Visualitation\n",
    "\n",
    "A streamlit app has been developed for the process. The user inputs an image and the program returns the transformed image, a color palette, and a series of images showing the painting process.\n",
